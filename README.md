Auction Catalogue
=================

by <a href="http://duanemoody.io" target="_blank">Duane M. Moody</a>.

The Auction Catalogue shows prospective buyers which items they may bid on for an upcoming auction. A buyer cannot actually purchase from the catalogue; they have to wait for the auction itself.

Epicodus Coursework Objectives
------------------------------

* Create a website for just one "type" of auction. On the Sotheby's website, they have different auctions for different art periods, but to make your life easier, just pick one type.
* Allow the auction company to add different "lots" - similar to categories - of products to be auctioned. For example, it could be a "lot" of vases, chairs, paintings etc.
* Allow the auction company to add individual products to each of the "lots" with information about that item - a description, owner, bid number, estimated starting price, backstory of the item, an image, year it was acquired, etc.
* Add in the ability to display thumbnails of all of the items in a particular "lot" with a small image and a very short description (owner, bid number, estimated starting price, etc).
* When someone clicks on a thumbnail, they should be shown a larger image and a longer description of the item that would include the same information as before but with a condition report or backstory of the item, and perhaps contact information for the owner/seller of the item.
